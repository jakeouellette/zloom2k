## Make a menu selector for the Paint tool

| View of current Buffer | Edit brush (Advanced dropdown) | Color selector, overlapping 2 colors* | Code button | 

Overlapping colors works different with text / layered objects.


## Brushes

Convert common Idioms / edit modes into different brush selections in a dropdown tool

* Eyedropper
* Paint
* Selection Tool
* Text Tool
* Flood Fill
* Gradient Fill
* Drawing

When in selection mode:

Currently, Clicking begins selection
Hitting Enter ends selection
Clicking again adjusts the second block.

Change to:

Clicking once begins selection, releasing ends selection
Clicking again starts a new selection.


## Random

* Infinite undo / redo buttons
* Recent brush buffer
* Maybe, put the cursor data and buffer data in the same place, and switch intelligently

## Bugs

* The BufferManager has some weird dragging funk: you can make it big, and dragging empty stuff is bad
